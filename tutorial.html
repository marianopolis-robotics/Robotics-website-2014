    <h1>Eliminating Random Noise in ROBOTC</h1>
<p>

While on radio control, have you ever noticed your robot’s motors jerking randomly, even though you’re not pressing any buttons? What about the entire robot drifting off to one side when it’s supposed to stay still? Random noise being picked up by the radio receiver is likely causing this. The easiest way to solve this problem is to filter out low signals from the remote in your program. Any signal below a certain threshold value will be dropped, making your robot easier to control. Here’s how to do it!
    <br />
    <br />
Let’s start out with a very basic program. We can assume the robot has two powered wheels, left and right, and two non-powered casters. We want to map the vertical motion of the right joystick to the right motor and the vertical motion of the left joystick to the left motor:
    <br />
    <img src="img/ide1.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;"/>
    <br />
For those of you new to programming, I’ll explain the above code line-by-line:
    <br />
    <br />
 1, 2, 3: The first three lines are generated by ROBOTC when you run the motor and sensor configuration wizard. To run it, go to the “Tools” menu and select “Motors and Sensors Setup. You will be prompted to name your motors, and give their types. Depending on their positioning, you may need to reverse them too. For most motors, you won’t need to worry about the last two options.
    <br />
    <br />
5: The main() task is where the robot always begins in the execution of your code. Only the code within it will be run. For more complex programs, you can organize your code into many tasks that work together.
    <br />
    <br />
7: While-loops re-run whatever code is contained in them while their condition is true. This while-loop will run indefinitely, since the condition inside it is always true. It ensures that your robot is always searching for new input from the controller and adjusting its speed accordingly.
    <br />
    <br />
9, 10: Here, the program takes the values of Channels 2 and 3 (Vertical signals from the right and left joysticks respectively) and uses them as input for the speed of the right and left motors respectively.
All in all, this program results in tank-style controls. Pushing both joysticks forward or backward moves the robot forward and back respectively, pushing them in opposite directions makes the robot spin, and so on. The problem is that this program is susceptible to interference, because any signal the robot receives will cause the robot to move. We need to prevent low values from being registered to filter out random noise. The following code will account for this:
    <br />
    <img src="img/ide2.jpg" alt="Image" title="Image" style="max-width:100%; max-height:100%;"/>
    <br />

Now to explain the differences in this version of the code:
    <br />
    <br />
7, 8, 9: Outside of the main loop, three new variables are initialized. A user-defined threshold value, and two variables that will store the joystick values pre-filtering. In general, if you are going to use one value many times in your code, you should define a variable to hold it so that you will quickly and easily be able to change it while tweaking your code
    <br />
    <br />
13, 14: The joystick variables defined above are assigned the values read from the VEX controller.
    <br />
    <br />
16-23, 25-32: If a joystick variable’s absolute value is less than or equal to the threshold, the motor’s speed is set to 0. If a joystick variable is larger than the threshold value, that motor’s speed is set to the value it contains
    <br />
    <br />
Essentially, instead of directly assigning the remote input to the motor output, this code introduces an intermediate variable, and chooses whether to assign it to the output depending on its value. The overall effect is that your robot now has a tolerance for random noise, making it easier to control.</p>
