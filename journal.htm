            <h1>August 20th, 2013</h1>

            <p>This is it. A new city, a new job, a new school: a fresh start. Just what
            I need to turn the page over my adventurous past.</p>

            <p>12:45 &#8211; Activity Period</p>

            <p>&#8230;I was right, teaching at Marianopolis will sure be an enriching
            experience for me! However, my hopes of moving on from my past have gone down
            the drain.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Two students came up to me and enquired as to why I put an end to my
            archeological quests, so I recounted my failed retrieval of the sacred
            artifact in the ancient Amazonian temple. They then offered to help me with
            their Robotics Team at Marianopolis. They say their robot for this
            year&#8217;s competition would be capable of entering the temple: it would be
            able to unlock the door by stacking boulders onto the pressure plate, without
            activating the security mechanism around the temple entrance.<br />
            Clearly, my adventurous streak has far from died down: I plan to leave for
            the Amazon Rainforest with my assistants in February, right after the
            competition. Until then, the Robotics Team will give their all in the making
            of the robot that will successfully acquire the Golden Cup from the
            temple.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>October 10th, 2013</h1>

            <p>Team selection is now complete. I look forward to working with these
            students and my fellow professors, Simon Sabik and Dominique Paradis. These
            physicists will be there to confirm the students&#8217; ideas or to oppose
            them should they be incompatible with the principles of physics.</p>

            <h1>October 22nd, 2013</h1>

            <p>To fund our expedition, team members had a bake sale of a variety of
            sweets and salty goods at Marianopolis College.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>November 4th, 2013</h1>

            <p>The students informed me that they attended the robotics kick-off
            conference at Vanier College after which they were able to determine the
            specifics of their competition as well as the details of the website they
            will have to create.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>November 5th, 2013</h1>

            <p>I called a meeting during today&#8217;s Activity Period, from 12:45 to
            2:15 p.m., so that the team could discuss potential robot designs. From what
            I understood, an idea of a robot that could act as a ramp was proposed.
            Although it was not discarded, the suggestion of a forklift acting as the
            pickup system received more approval.<br />
            A few students, Daniel, Claudia, Fozail and Amanda suggested they film our
            daily progress so that we may retrace our steps easily should the need
            arise.</p>

            <h1>November 14th, 2013</h1>

            <p>The students met up again during Activity Period. From the descriptions I
            made of the temple and its layout, Jenny submitted to me a 3D virtual model
            of the temple. Referring to it will be useful when planning our journey. As
            for the robot, my assistants pointed out that a 360o rotation about the axis
            of the forklift, achieved with a turntable, would allow for more precision in
            the robot&#8217;s manoeuvres.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>November 19th, 2013</h1>

            <p>Things have gotten more hands-on in today&#8217;s working session. The
            members split up and started working on prototypes for the pick-up system and
            the chassis. Robotics not being my forte, I believe Professor Sabik&#8217;s
            supervision was significantly greater than mine!</p>
          </div>

            <h1>November 23rd, 2013</h1>

            <p>Teachers and assistants have finally found time to dedicate an entire
            Saturday for the development of the robot. Prototypes were refined and
            strengthened.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>We split the team into groups, in order for work to be accomplished more
            efficiently. Some students worked on the motors and on how to increase their
            speed without reducing their power, while others discussed the functioning of
            the pickup system and turntable. Some bent over the idea of the robot-ramp
            again, but arrived to no concrete solution, so they dropped it.<br />
            My assistants also came up with a list of supplies for Captain Smita to order
            online. Hopefully, the necessary materials will arrive on time for our next
            meeting.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <img src="img/journal/proto19dec.jpg"
                 alt="" />

            <h1>December 19th, 2013</h1>

            <p>The materials did arrive and the students put them to good use during
            today&#8217;s working session. Two sides of the robot&#8217;s base have been
            completed, and the pickup system is on its way.<br />
            I brought my assistants a little archaeological wonder today. When I was at
            the shrine in the Rainforest, I had seen, engraved upon the walls, scenes of
            the Ancients building the massive structure of the temple.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
          <p>I had taken pictures of those pictorial etchings, and today I looked for
          them in my archives and showed them to my team members.</p><img src=

          <div>
            <h1>December 20th, 2013</h1>

            <p>Now that exams are over and that the students are entirely focused on the
            project, things are moving quickly. The base is more or less complete. The
            pickup system, on the other hand, is too tight and therefore has difficulty
            sliding smoothly up and down due to excessive friction. It worries me that
            the group responsible for that part of the robot has yet to find a
            solution.</p>
          </div>

            <h1>December 21st, 2013</h1>

            <p>The base, without bearing any weight, moves very quickly. Speed is
            essential for the competition. I also know from experience that such
            maneuverability will be useful for swerving around booby traps and for
            dodging spikes shooting out of the temple&#8217;s walls.<br />
            Those working on the pickup system are fiddling with it, trying to find a
            solution to the friction. They intend to try out a new rail design after the
            Holidays.</p>
          </div>

            <h1>January 6th, 2014</h1>

            <p>Vacations have come and gone and we are back on track, even if classes
            have not yet resumed. The students forgo a restful break to come and work
            here tirelessly, day in day out. Their dedication garners my admiration.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>For the pickup system, Steven came up with a mechanism incorporating a
            pulley as well as wheels on either side of the support beam. The wheel system
            was designed and built today by a group of students, while another team
            started working on the turntable. Small wheels were added between the two
            plates of the turntable to keep them from wobbling.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>January 7th, 2014</h1>

            <p>My colleague Professor Sabik and I have supervised the completion of the
            vertical lift&#8217;s carriage system with wheels. As for the turntable, the
            students originally thought of placing it in the centre of the base, but
            quickly realised that this prevented the lifting system from operating
            properly. To give the pickup mechanism more room, they had to displace the
            turntable towards the front of the robot.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>My assistants also started working on the claw. For the prototype, they
            had experimented with rubber bands, but for the actual robot, they used
            surgical tubing to create tension in the arm, thus allowing it to grab
            objects.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>January 8th, 2014</h1>

            <p>Well, I must say, a very significant development has occurred today: the
            turntable has been completely discarded. My assistants deemed it unstable,
            cumbersome, not to mention unnecessary. It would consume too much energy, and
            they believe, now that they have tested it out, that the robot is nimble
            enough to not require the extra rotation of the turntable.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>The students also fixed the pickup system onto the chassis. It glides well
            on the rails, albeit a little jerkily. However, when a cement-filled bucket
            was attached to it, the fishing line serving as the pulley&#8217;s rope
            snapped. We most definitely need to find a better string.</p>
          </div>

            <h1>January 9th, 2014</h1>

            <p>The team working on the robot added a secondary translational motion kit,
            thinking that it would allow the robot to lift objects higher, but the
            addition only served to make the claw more flimsy. They took it down and,
            instead, they simply made the original rails much higher. I have often
            offered my encouragements during periods of difficulty, but it is Professor
            Paradis&#8217; presence which drives the students to pick up the pace.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>January 10th, 2014</h1>

            <p>I was awfully alarmed when I entered the robotics room and saw that the
            entire robot had been taken apart! My assistants quickly reassured me that
            they simply dismantled everything in order to widen the chassis. The base
            needed to be enlarged so that the robot would not tip over when moving up the
            steep ramp. To confer it more stability, the students also transposed the
            lifting mechanism more towards the center of the base.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Initially, it was impossible to place it there due to the turntable, but
            since that particular piece has been scrapped, centering the pickup system no
            longer is an issue.<br />
            At the end of the day, when the students pieced the robot back together, they
            made it such that the tower can be easily removed from the base. This modular
            design will be useful if ever the robot needs repairing.</p>
          </div>

            <p>While others continued to tweak the robot, assistants Yu Si and Erik have
            started wiring it. They plan to tuck the electrical board under the
            chassis.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>January 13th, 2014</h1>

            <p>The team had built a replica of the playing field&#8217;s ramp, but,
            despite keeping our fingers crossed, the robot was unable to climb it. My
            assistants trudged back to the robotics workshop to try and fix the problem.
            They changed the omni wheels to normal wheels, a solution which turned out
            unsuccessful. They switched the wheels back to the original ones, but decided
            to lock these omni wheels when the robot moves up the ramp. This would, they
            believe, give it more stability.</p>

            <p>It is the final stretch!</p>

            <p>The electrical board has been completed and an Energy Chain runs the wires
            up the tower towards the claw. My assistants realised today that the robot
            did not fit the prescribed dimensions. Better late than never: they have now
            modified the position of the locking omni wheels in order to decrease the
            robot&#8217;s width.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h1>January 21st, 2014</h1>

            <p>Ferly and Erik have been chosen as the robot&#8217;s drivers. While the
            tryouts were ongoing, I had a chat with the students and we reflected back on
            the past two weeks of vacation that were sacrificed to the development of the
            robot. So much heart, dedication and energy has been put into this
            undertaking that each of us hopes the effort will not have been in vain.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Being my project assistant must not have been an easy ride. And yet,
            despite the many troubles, they said that it has been a tremendous learning
            experience, not only in robot building, but equally in team communication. We
            are a considerably large team, so coordinating the activities of every
            subgroup was sometimes a pain. Captain Smita has sure acquired project
            management skills, while the rest of the team members have just as certainly
            honed their problem solving abilities. Difficulties in the conception and
            construction of the robot cropped up one after the other, and, although
            sometimes frustrated, the students have learned to face them with a sharp and
            supple mind. The video subgroup also mentioned that they learned a great deal
            about filming, particularly how time consuming it can be.</p>

            me: my assistants have brought it to a whole new level. Is it not fitting to
            say that Man ever continues to evolve and perfect his tools?...</p>
